# Jiffy Proposal 

## Abstract

Ethereum allows developers to create applications without worrying about servers, frontend, security of data and a plethora of other stuff web2.0 applications have to worry about. Its a great feeling to deploy the contract on a testnet and just share the contract address to possible users. Interacting with contracts deployed is tough without a dedicated front-end even for experienced technocrats, you have to get the abi, contract address,make sure he/she has ether, know the inputs and expected outputs to make sure you are doing it right. A user runs out of patience and/or motivation to try out your contract if he has to go through so much hassle. We want to encourage on boarding of new users so that they can interact with contracts in a **jiffy** without worrying about the overhead stuff. We want to make trying out contracts as straight-forward as possible for new users as well as existing devs.

## Deliverables

We have several things in the roadmap to make this happen:
    - Creation of markdown labels which can be attached to readme files of github repo, users can just click that to send a transaction after altering parameters.
    - Allowing meta transactions ie users can interact with the contract with erc20 tokens or with no ether/erc20 tokens.
    - Homepage for all functions of a smart contract which can be shared to potential users as a frontend for the application(with unique jiffy subdomain)
    - Allowing users to watch a specific types of transactions using ethereum events.
    - Using predictive deployment to allow users to send tokens/ether to each other using URL's/QR

UI/UX , usability being the primary motivation we aim to bring new users onboard as quickly as possible without knowing anything about blockchain.
